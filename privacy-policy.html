    <h1>Privacy Policy for Service Dashboard App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 11, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>GitMoose is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Service Dashboard app (“App”) handles information, including potential future updates that may require access to certain device data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Currently, we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users of this App. We prioritize your privacy and aim to keep your experience as secure and private as possible. The App is designed to display information and facilitate customer communications without requiring access to personal data.</p>

    <h2>2. Future Updates</h2>
    <p>In future releases, we may introduce additional features to enhance user experience and functionality. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Services:</strong> In a future release, we may enable GPS-based location services. This feature would allow users to share their current location via text message directly within the App. When this feature is implemented, you will have full control over its use and can choose whether to enable location sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App does not share any data with third parties. If any updates in the future require data sharing, you will be notified and given the choice to opt in.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, no specific security measures are in place. However, all communications with our servers are encrypted to ensure the highest level of protection for any potential data transmission.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time as the App evolves. Any changes will be posted here, and we will notify you of significant updates to ensure your continued awareness and consent.</p>
